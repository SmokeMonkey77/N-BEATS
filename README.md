# N-BEATS
This project uses the **N-BEATS (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series)** model to implement time series forecasting and provides a complete training, validation, and testing workflow.

The model is implemented in Python using PyTorch and can be applied to univariate or multivariate time series data.
It is suitable for equipment degradation trend prediction, remaining useful life (RUL) estimation, and general time series forecasting tasks.

1.Implementation of the N-BEATS model architecture

2.Support for customizable training parameters (epochs, learning rate, batch size)

3.Complete training and testing scripts
